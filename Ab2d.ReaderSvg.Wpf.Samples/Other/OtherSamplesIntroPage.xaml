                    The currently running \bReaderSvgSamples\b application contain only the most importants samples for the Ab2d.ReaderSvg library.\n
                    \n
                    But the library comes with some other samples in other projects and solutions:\n
                    \n
                    \*\bResourceDictionaryWriter\b solution is a WPF application that can be used to create a ResourceDictionary XAML from multiple svg files (in a separate solution).
                    \n
                    \*\bReaderSvg.WinFormsSample\b solution shows how easy is to use Ab2d.ReaderSvg inside WinForms application (in a separate solution).\n
                    \n
                    \*Two \bSilverlight samples\b show how to use XAML created from svg file with ViewerSvg (in the same solution as ReaderSvgSamples application).\n
                    \n
                    \*\bSvgToPngConverter\b solution is a simple console application that can be used to convert svg files to png or jpg files (in a separate solution).\n
